# Mindful-Moments-AI-Companion
An empathetic AI-powered wellness companion that offers real-time support, ethical guidance, and a pixel-perfect user experience.

## Inspiration  
Mental health support is often inaccessible, stigmatized, or delayed. We wanted to create a tool that provides **instant, empathetic, and ethical guidance** through AI-driven conversations. Our inspiration came from seeing how students and professionals struggle to find timely support, and how technology could bridge that gap.

## What it does  
**Mindful Moments AI Companion** is an AI-powered wellness assistant that:  
- Offers real-time, sentiment-aware chat support  
- Provides curated resources and ethical guidance flows  
- Switches seamlessly between providers (Gemini/OpenAI) for reliability  
- Delivers a **pixel-perfect UI/UX** designed for comfort and trust  

Users can chat, reflect, and access resources in one place, making mental wellness more approachable.

## How we built it  
- **Backend**: FastAPI with robust error handling and provider fallback logic  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS for rapid prototyping and polished design  
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript for algorithmic modules  
- **Integrations**: Gemini and OpenAI APIs for conversational AI  
- **Version Control**: GitHub for collaboration and transparency  

We focused on modular architecture: frontend (UI), backend (API + logic), and provider integration.

## Challenges we ran into  
- Handling **API key expiration** and quota limits (solved with fallback + error logging)  
- Designing a UI that balances **aesthetic appeal with accessibility**  
- Debugging backend integrations across multiple providers  
- Ensuring ethical safeguards to prevent harmful outputs  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- Successfully deployed a working AI companion with **provider switching**  
- Built a **modern, intuitive interface** that feels safe and welcoming  
- Implemented robust error handling and transparent logging  
- Learned to balance speed (hackathon deadlines) with polish (design excellence)  

## What we learned  
- Importance of **rate limiting** and retry logic when working with APIs  
- How to design **ethical AI flows** that prioritize user safety  
- Value of **team collaboration and rapid iteration** in hackathons  
- Technical lessons in backend debugging, environment variable management, and API integration  

## What's next for Mindful Moments AI Companion  
- Expand features: journaling, meditation reminders, and resource directories  
- Deploy to mobile platforms for wider accessibility  
- Integrate cloud databases for multi-user support  
- Explore advanced sentiment analysis using datasets and fine-tuned models  
- Scale to support communities, schools, and workplaces
